# 🎲 Probability & Statistics Simulations using Python (Google Colab)

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating key **probability and statistics concepts**, all tested and executed in **Google Colab**.  
Each file simulates real-world probability problems, helping visualize and understand statistical behavior through computation.

---

## 📘 Project Overview  

These Python scripts explore:
- 🎯 Dice roll probabilities  
- 🧮 Conditional probability (sum given a condition)  
- 🔗 Event independence  
- 📊 Discrete random variables and Probability Mass Functions (PMFs)

Each script uses **random number generation**, **statistical formulas**, and **data visualization** to explain concepts interactively.

## 📂 Files Included  

| File Name                    | Description |

| `dice_probability.py`        | Simulates multiple dice rolls and calculates the probability of rolling a target number. |
| `conditional_probability.py` | Calculates the probability that the sum is 7 given that one die shows 4. |
| `event_independence.py`      | Checks if two events A and B are independent using P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B). |
| `pmf_die_roll.py`            | Displays the PMF (Probability Mass Function) for a die roll and computes its expected value and variance. |
